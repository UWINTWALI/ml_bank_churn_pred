================================================================================
Execution Date: 2026-02-08 21:42:03
Model Type: Cost-Sensitive Logistic Regression (Single Model)

DATA SUMMARY:
- Total samples: 10,000
- Training samples: 8,000
- Test samples: 2,000
- Churn rate: 20.37%

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Precision: 36.52%
- Recall: 75.92%
- F1-Score: 0.493
- ROC-AUC: 0.777

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Predicted churners: 846
- True churners identified: 309
- Unnecessary promotions: 537
- Missed churners: 98
- Net business value: $201,600
- Cost per saved customer: $348

MODEL CONFIGURATION:
- Model: Logistic Regression with class weights {0: 1, 1: 3}
- Decision Threshold: 0.4
- Business Assumption: Missing a churner costs 3x more than false positive

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Use threshold 0.4 to catch 75.9% of churners
2. Expected campaign size: 846 customers
3. Expected savings: $309,000 from 309 saved customers
4. Promotion cost: $107,400 for 537 false positives
5. Cost-benefit ratio: 1:2.9 (savings:cost)

BUSINESS INSIGHTS:
- Model catches 75.9% of potential churners
- 36.5% of predicted churners will actually churn
- For every $1 spent on promotions, you save $2.88
- Each saved customer costs $348 in promotion waste
